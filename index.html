                        Online food ordering and delivery platforms are websites and applications that allow their users
                        to order food from nearby restaurants and have their orders delivered to their location, all
                        through the Internet. Examples of such platforms include Yemeksepeti [1] and Uber Eats [2].
                        Platforms like these can have a high number of users, which results in the need to manage a big
                        amount of possibly valuable data. This data can include important information about the
                        customers such as name, address, phone, e-mail address; as well as information about each
                        restaurant such as address, working hours, delivery range and menu. Therefore, such platforms
                        tend to require a database system to be able to manage such large amounts of data.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        In this report, we propose a similar web-based application that manages a food ordering and
                        delivery system. We first give a brief description as to what the project is, and justify our
                        decision of using a database system by stating why and how we use it. We then specify our
                        project requirements, which includes functional requirements, non-functional requirements and
                        constraints. After that, we move onto the limitations section where we specify the limitations
                        we assert on what each type of user is allowed to do. Thereafter, we provide an Entity
                        Relationship Diagram corresponding to our database system and describe that diagram. Finally, we
                        sum up the project in the conclusion section and list our references.

                        E-meal is a web-based application with the purpose of managing a food ordering and delivery
                        system. In the system, there exist restaurants, their menus, the food and beverages offered in
                        those menus, and certain actions such as rating and reviewing deliveries. The users of the
                        system consist of restaurant owners, customers of the restaurants, and delivery guys working for
                        the restaurants. Customers should be able to make an order from a restaurant of their choice, in
                        which they are allowed to select any number of items from the restaurant's menu. Here, the
                        system is supposed to check if the customers have enough credit to make their orders. If so, the
                        order should be processed and a free driver is assigned for the task of delivery. After the
                        delivery process is complete, i.e. the customers' orders are delivered to their locations,
                        customers are expected to rate and review both the restaurant and the driver.
                        Furthermore, it should be noted that we will be adding additional functionalities to the system,
                        for the sake of creativity. That is, we will be providing vegetarian-friendly and gluten-free
                        meal options for customers; as well as an advertisement system for restaurants.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why We Need a Database System</h3>
                    <p class="text">
                        A database system can be used to handle data collections that are relatively large, quite
                        valuable,
                        and accessed by multiple users, mostly simultaneously [3].
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        A food ordering and delivery system needs to store the information of their users, the orders,
                        registered restaurants, ratings and reviews. This data can accumulate and reach a quite large
                        amount
                        in a short amount of time. In addition, it can contain highly important data, such as the credit
                        card information of their users. Furthermore, such a system can be accessed by many users at the
                        same time and, therefore, must support concurrent transactions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        Consequently, using a database system instead of an arbitrary file system can be highly
                        advantageous.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How We Use a Database System</h3>
                    <p class="text">
                        Our database system will store information about the users such as name, address, phone,
                        e-mails,
                        etc. There are three types of users, customers, restaurant owners and delivery guys, the
                        database
                        will provide specific functions to the users according to their type. The database will have the
                        information about restaurants and their menus. In addition, information about the
                        functionalities
                        such as giving review and ratings, creating a basket and placing an order will be stored and
                        displayed by the database.
