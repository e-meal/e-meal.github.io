<p>Online food ordering and delivery platforms are websites and applications that allow their users to order food from nearby restaurants and have their orders delivered to their location, all through the Internet. Examples of such platforms include Yemeksepeti [1] and Uber Eats [2]. Platforms like these can have a high number of users, which results in the need to manage a big amount of possibly valuable data. This data can include important information about the customers such as name, address, phone, e-mail address; as well as information about each restaurant such as address, working hours, delivery range and menu. Therefore, such platforms tend to require a database system to be able to manage such large amounts of data. 
In this report, we propose a similar web-based application that manages a food ordering and delivery system. We first give a brief description as to what the project is, and justify our decision of using a database system by stating why and how we use it. We then specify our project requirements, which includes functional requirements, non-functional requirements and constraints. After that, we move onto the limitations section where we specify the limitations we assert on what each type of user is allowed to do. Thereafter, we provide an Entity Relationship Diagram corresponding to our database system and describe that diagram. Finally, we sum up the project in the conclusion section and list our references.</p>
