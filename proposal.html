                        Online food ordering and delivery platforms are websites and applications that allow their
                        users to order food from nearby restaurants and have their orders delivered to their location,
                        all through the Internet. Examples of such platforms include Yemeksepeti [1] and Uber Eats
                        [2]. Platforms like these can have a high number of users, which results in the need to
                        manage a significant amount of possibly valuable data. This data can include important
                        information about the customers such as name, address, phone, e-mail address, as well as
                        information about each restaurant, such as an address, working hours, delivery range, and
                        menu. Therefore, such platforms tend to require a database system to manage such large
                        amounts of data.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        In this report, we propose a similar web-based application that manages a food ordering and
                        delivery system. We first give a brief description of the project and justify our decision to
                        use
                        a database system by stating why and how we use it. We then specify our project
                        requirements, which include functional requirements, non-functional requirements and
                        constraints. After that, we move onto the limitations section, where we specify the limitations
                        we assert on what each type of user is allowed to do. Afterward, we provide an Entity
                        Relationship Diagram corresponding to our database system and describe that diagram.
                        Finally, we sum up the project in the conclusion section and list our references.

                        E-Meal is a web-based application with the purpose of managing a food ordering and
                        delivery system. In the system, there exist restaurants, their menus, the food and beverages
                        offered in those menus, customer and delivery personnel information, and orders. The system
                        users consist of restaurant owners, customers of the restaurants, and delivery guys working
                        for the restaurants. Customers should be able to make an order from a restaurant of their
                        choice, in which they are allowed to select any number of items from the restaurant's menu.
                        Here, the system is supposed to check if the customers have enough credit to make their
                        orders. If so, the order should be processed, and a free driver is assigned for delivery. After
                        the delivery process is complete, i.e., the customers' orders are delivered to their locations,
                        customers can rate and review both the restaurant and the driver.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        Furthermore, it should be noted that we will be adding additional functionalities to the system
                        for the sake of having a comprehensive initial design. That is, we will be providing
                        vegetarian-friendly, vegan-friendly and gluten-free filters for food and restaurants, as well as
                        an advertisement system for restaurants. We will also provide a system where restaurant
                        owners can define a number of different options for each food item in their restaurant menus,
                        and customers can select a subset of these options for each food item they order.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why We Need a Database System</h3>
                    <p class="text">
                        A database system can be used to handle data collections that are relatively large,
                        quite valuable, and accessed by multiple users, mostly simultaneously [3].
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        A food ordering and delivery system needs to store the information of their users, the
                        orders, registered restaurants, ratings and reviews. This data can accumulate and reach
                        quite large volumes in a short amount of time. In addition, it can contain highly
                        sensitive data, such as the credit card information of its users. Furthermore, such a
                        system can be accessed by many users at the same time and, therefore, must support
                        concurrent transactions and handle any conflicts.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        Consequently, using a database system instead of an arbitrary file system can be
                        highly advantageous.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How We Use a Database System</h3>
                    <p class="text">
                        Our database system will store information about the users such as name, address,
                        phone, e-mails, etc. There are three types of users: customers, restaurant owners and
                        delivery guys. The database will provide specific functions to the users according to
                        their type. In addition, it will have information about restaurants and their menus.
                        Besides, information about the functionalities such as giving reviews and ratings,
                        creating a basket, and placing an order will be stored and displayed by the database.

                        to place banners on the website. The entities <i>Food</i> and <i>Beverages</i> inherit from the
                        <i>Items</i>
                        entity because they have many common attributes. The <i>Options</i> entity is in a many-to-one
                        relation with the <i>Items</i> entity, enabling the customer to add options to an item. The
                        purpose of
                        the <i>Item_Instances</i> entity is to add items to the basket after the item options are
                        selected.
                        This
                        entity is in a 1-to-Many relation with the Options and Many-to-1 with the Items . The
                        <i>Basket</i>
                        entity is for gathering the items that will be ordered. While this entity is in a many-to-many
                        relation with the <i>Item_Instances</i> to enable the items to be added to the basket, it is in
                        a
                        many-to-one relation with both the <i>Customer</i> and the <i>Restaurant</i> in order that both
                        customers
                        and the restaurants see the basket. The <i>Order</i> entity is in a one-to-one relation with the
                        <i>Basket</i>
                        entity and is in a many-to-one relation with <i>Delivery Guy</i> to assign the order's delivery
                        for a
                        driver or rider. The <i>Order</i> entity is in a one-to-many relation with the <i>Ratings</i>
                        and <i>Reviews</i>
                        weak entities. This ensures that customers can review and rate their orders, and the
                        restaurants can see the ratings and reviews added to the order.

                        In conclusion, we aim to create a system in which multiple food orders and deliveries will
                        take place at the same time, without the need for direct communication between customers,
                        restaurants and deliverers. We will be naming this system e-Meal . Throughout this report, we
                        have specified the functionalities and the limitations we have decided to give to our system;
                        and established its overall structure with an Entity Relationship diagram. Here, it is important
                        to point out that we will be providing certain additional functionalities such as
                        vegetarian-friendly, vegan-friendly and gluten-free filters for food and restaurants, as well as
                        an advertisement system for restaurants. Furthermore, we will provide a system where
                        restaurant owners can define a number of different options for each food item in their
                        restaurant menus and customers can select a subset of these options for each food item they
                        order. Finally, during the implementation phase, we are planning to use MySQL as a database
                        management system, PHP for back-end development and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for
                        front-end development.
